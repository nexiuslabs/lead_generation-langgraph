Here's the ICP I drafted from the customer sites you shared: Summary B2B F&B operators in Singapore and nearby urban markets who need reliable, cost‑effective wholesale supply of ambient, chilled and specialty imported products. Ideal targets are restaurants/cafes, hotels/caterers and retailers that prioritize next‑day delivery, cold‑chain capability, broad SKU selection (including specialty imports) and predictable pricing/ minimums.

Industries

Restaurants, cafes & quick‑service chains
Hotels, bars & catering/event companies
Retailers & specialty grocers (incl. Japanese/ethnic stores)
Company Sizes

Small independents / single‑site owners (1–10 outlets)
Mid‑size operators & regional chains (10–100 outlets)
Large foodservice groups & hotel chains (100+ outlets)
Regions

Singapore (primary)
Greater Singapore metro / urban centres
Near‑term expansion: Malaysia & SEA city markets
Key Pains

Unreliable supply & stockouts that disrupt menus
Need for guaranteed cold‑chain and specialist storage
High delivery costs / inflexible minimum order thresholds
Buying Triggers

Opening new outlets or scaling a multi‑site rollout
Seasonal spikes, events or new menu launches
Supplier price increases or service failures/stockouts
Personas

Procurement Manager / Buyer
Head Chef / Executive Chef
F&B Operations Manager
Proof Points

Next‑day delivery windows (order-before-4PM) — lowers stock risk
Free delivery thresholds (e.g., S$80+) — reduces OPEX for smaller buyers
Extensive cold‑chain & logistics: refrigerated fleet + large warehousing (e.g., 5,000+ sqm) Does that look right? Confirm or suggest edits before I start discovery.
