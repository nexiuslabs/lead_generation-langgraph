I will infer industries from evidence instead of asking. What I will crawl:

Your site: Industries served, Customers/Case Studies, Integrations, Pricing (ACV hints), Careers (buyer/team clues), Partners, blog topics.
Seed and anti-customer sites: industry labels, product lines, About text, Careers (roles/scale), Integrations pages, locations. Then I’ll run web discovery to propose a Top‑10 lookalikes list with evidence. ACRA is only used later in the nightly SG pass.
