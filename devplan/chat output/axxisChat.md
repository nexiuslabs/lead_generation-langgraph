I will infer industries from evidence instead of asking. What I will crawl:

Your site: Industries served, Customers/Case Studies, Integrations, Pricing (ACV hints), Careers (buyer/team clues), Partners, blog topics.
Seed and anti-customer sites: industry labels, product lines, About text, Careers (roles/scale), Integrations pages, locations. Then I’ll run web discovery to propose a Top‑10 lookalikes list with evidence. ACRA is only used later in the nightly SG pass.

Here are your leads:

Name	Domain	Industry	Employees	Score	Bucket	Rationale	Contact
fbma.sg	fbma.sg	None	None	100.0	high	This company demonstrates strong potential for engagement due to its active status as a registered entity (sg_registered: True) and its involvement in research activities, as indicated by the presence of two research evidence counts (research_ev_count: 2). The lack of employee and revenue data suggests it may be an emerging player in its industry, making it a prime candidate for outreach to explore growth opportunities and potential partnerships.
